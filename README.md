# loc_camp_app

A simple Flutter application is implemented using Clean architecture that demonstrates your proficiency with Firebase services:
Firebase Auth to handle the process of saving user info and using it to log in to the app 
Cloud Messages: 
send notifications from FCM in all cases (Foreground, background, and if terminated) 
with support of local notifications after successful login by(2 second)
Consuming REST APIs, handling no internet cases with caching: 
if there is no internet connection, cache the data retrieved from the API and show it 
and once the internet connection is back, re-retrieve the data from the API.
cand implementing simple animations: 
transition animation between screens, animated list items, button animations.

if you need this REST API
you can get api from [here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
